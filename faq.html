      <p id="QUE">Que:Where can I find out more about code development?
        Ans:You might want to start by reviewing the legacy information on OpenOffice.org development. Or, take a look at information posted on the Apache OpenOffice wiki under Documentation - For Developers.

        Of course, you will need the source code to do anything. We recommend building in your own environment as a first step.
        
        You don't have to be an actual committer to submit code. You can submit patches through the Apache OpenOffice Bugzilla issue reporting system. You simply need to file an issue and supply your patch as an attachment to the issue.
        
        Please also see our Orientation Modules for information on how the project works and identifying outstanding development tasks.<br><br>
        Que:I've just been voted in as a Committer. What do I need to do?
        Ans:First, congratulations. Your contributions to the project have been noted and we hope that as a Committer you will be even more active.

        But before you are officially given Committer permissions, there are a few administrative steps that you will need to complete.
        
        Submit a signed ICLA to Apache.
        
        Wait for the ICLA to be received and recorded by Apache. You will know when this has occurred when your name appears in the Unlisted ICLAs section on the Apache Committers page. This could take a couple of days, longer if you submitted the ICLA via post.
        
        Once the your ICLA has been recorded, you should send a note to the PMC and request an Apache account. You will want to include your full name and email address, as you entered in the ICLA, as well as your preferred userid. Please check first that your preferred userid is not already in use by another Apache Committer.
        
        Once your Apache account has been created, you will receive an email with further instructions for setting up your account. This may take a couple of days.
        
        If you were also voted as a PMC member, you should then subscribe to the PMC's private mailing list.
        
        Finally, you should read the "Guide for new committers"<br><br>
        Que: I'm not a committer, but would like to contribute, what should I development?
        Ans:Apache OpenOffice welcomes your contributions!

        The project now uses Git.
        
        To contribute to the OpenOffice product, you will need to submit subversion patches ("diff" files), and attach them to issues in our issues reporting system, Bugzilla.
        
        Your contributions will be recognized by the committer submitting the PATCH in the log entry for the committed patch, and you will be added to the OpenOffice credits page to recognize your contribution.
